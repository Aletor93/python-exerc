x = 11        so...    there is two iteration of 1             so...   result is 21
x = 21        so...    there's one iter of 2, one iter of 1    so...   result is 1211
x = 1211      so...    there's one iter of 1, one iter of 2,
                       and two iteration of 1                  so...   result is 111221
