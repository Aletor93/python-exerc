## fibonacci-sequence

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fnâ€Š, form a sequence, the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors omit the initial terms and start the sequence from 1 and 1 or from 1 and 2.

Usage  ;  fibonacci.py <iteration> |or| fibonacci.py r <iteration>
  
  exemple  ; fibonacci.py 4        will return 3

```


## fizz-buzz

print 50 random integer between 0 and 100, if the random integer is a multiple of 3, print Fizz instead of the int. if the random integer is a multiple of 5 print Buzz, and if the random integer is a multiple of both, print FizzBuzz.


## rainbow-waterfall

just random string, random length, random color, etc....

## read-and-spell

Read how many time a number is followed in a string, for exemple ; 
```
x = 1         so...    there is one iteration of 1             so...   result is 11
x = 11        so...    there is two iteration of 1             so...   result is 21
x = 21        so...    there's one iter of 2, one iter of 1    so...   result is 1211
x = 1211      so...    there's one iter of 1, one iter of 2,
                       and two iteration of 1                  so...   result is 111221
                       etc...
                       etc...
